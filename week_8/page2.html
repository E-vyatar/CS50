                    One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility.
                    In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.
                    From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today.
                    He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never.
                    In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:
                    <br>
                    • How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”
                    <br>
                    • How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars
                    <br>
                    • How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology
                    <br>
                    • Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one
                    <br>
                    Kaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it.
                    An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.

                    After a long and eventful life, Allan Karlsson ends up in a nursing home, believing it to be his last stop.
                    The only problem is that he’s still in good health.
                    A big celebration is in the works for his 100th birthday, but Allan really isn’t interested (and he’d like a bit more control over his alcohol consumption), so he decides to escape.
                    He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey.
                    It would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: he has not only witnessed some of the most important events of the 20th century, but actually played a key role in them.
                    Quirky and utterly unique, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has charmed readers across the world.

                        Now he's a big brother, and spends his days teaching his twin siblings the important things in life, such as how to properly summon a waiter at a French restaurant.
                        But when Artemis Fowl's mother contracts a life-threatening illness, his world is turned upside down. The only hope for a cure lies in the brain fluid of the silky sifaka lemur.
                        Unfortunately, the animal is extinct due to a heartless bargain Artemis himself made as a younger boy.
                        Though the odds are stacked against him, Artemis is not willing to give up.
                        With the help of his fairy friends, the young genius travels back in time to save the lemur and bring it back to the present.
                        But to do so, Artemis will have to defeat a maniacal poacher, who has set his sights on new prey: Holly Short.
                        The rules of time travel are far from simple, but to save his mother, Artemis will have to break them all and outsmart his most cunning adversary yet: Artemis Fowl, age ten.

                        Seemingly nothing in this world daunts the young criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl.
                        In the fairy world, however, there is a small thing that has gotten under his skin on more than one occasion: Opal Koboi.
                        In The Last Guardian, the evil pixie is wreaking havoc yet again.
                        This time his arch rival has somehow reanimated dead fairy warriors who were buried in the grounds of Fowl Manor.
                        Their spirits have possessed Artemis’s little brothers, making his siblings even more annoying than usual.
                        The warriors don’t seem to realize that the battle they were fighting when they died—a battle against Artemis—is long over.
                        Artemis has until sunrise to get the spirits to vacate his brothers and go back into the earth where they belong.
                        Can he count on a certain LEPrecon fairy to join him in what could well be his last stand?
